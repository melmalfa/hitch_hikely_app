Project Name: hitch.hike.ly

Description: A team microblog where users can anonymously post stories about their hitch-hiking experiences.

Gems used:
'redis' - I really do not know how to describe this. It facilitates communication between Ruby and the Redis server???
'sinatra' - Sinatra is a DSL (domain-specific language). The gem allows us to communicate with the Sinatra server???
'sinatra-contrib'- This is 'a collection of useful Sinatra extensions' (https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-contrib).

Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost: not sure. Do you mean downloading it from heroku?

Instructions for running the accompanying test suite: I don't know what the accompanying test suite is.
